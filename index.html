						<p> I remember being 12 years old sitting in my old creaky house on 
						Stephenson street in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere listening 
						to Pandora radio when this song played for the first time. I started 
						dancing ballet so young I can’t remember my first class and I started 
						playing violin the same year I found this artist, so classical music 
						had such a soft place in my young heart. I immediately did a deep 
						dive on the artist, Olafur Arnalds, and became consumed by his work and 
						life story. I discovered the language of the title was his mother tongue: 
						Icelandic. I became enthralled by Iceland, the culture, and the beauty of 
						the country. 
						Around the same time in my life, I experienced my first panic attack. My 
						mom taught me how to use different coping skills to help me ground myself 
						when the panic or anxiety was reaching a breaking point. I found that listening 
						to this album helped me more than anything, that looking at pictures of 
						Iceland brought me a sense of calm I have never been able to describe properly. 
						I went through the album and translated each of the titles. This song in 
						particular translates to “Slowly, comes light” and even before knowing the 
						meaning of the title it resonated with me most. The title felt hopeful and I 
						kept it with me through my darkest moments. I knew from 14 years old it would 
						be my first tattoo and as soon as I turned 18 I made that a reality.</p>

					<p id="wildonion1-text" class="handwritten">Despite being easily assumed a California native now, I spent 
						the first 14 years of my life in a tiny midwest farm town in the most northern part of Illinois. At 
						the time, I hated that we didn’t have internet in my house until 8th grade. Now 
						looking back, I am deeply grateful for all the time I spent bored, making giant 
						messes, and playing outside as a kid. 
						Between the nature reserves and weekends/holidays on my grandpa’s farm, I spent 
						hundreds of hours exploring the outdoors and wading my way through the natural 
						foliage of the rural midwest. I have so many graphic memories of getting lost on 
						winding trails or catching minnows in ponds on my Pak’s farm with the overwhelming 
						smell of hay and wild onions in the air. Smells like childhood and home. 
						Finding a wild onion always felt like a treasure, I remember thinking “Onions 
						belong in grocery stores!” I always felt pride when I could identify them properly 
						as a kid and pull them out of the ground to show my adults. Now I have one growing 
						permanently out of my shoe.

						<div id="mimi1-text" class="handwritten"><p>I can’t remember the first time my mom showed me 
							the musical RENT, but I know I was young enough that most of it 
							went over my head. She started showing me movies she loved with 
							iconic queer figures like “To Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything” and I 
							fell in love with drag queens and the very little I knew about the 
							queer community by watching this movie and I wanted more. Despite 
							a lot of the more serious aspects of the plot going over my head, 
							I fell in love with RENT for the music and the characters—especially 
							Maureen and Joann, a lesbian couple. 
							It wasn’t until I was 16 that I properly pieced together my own queer 
							identity but from a very young age I felt a deep resonation with the very 
							few queer women I knew of. This movie adaptation of a broadway musical 
							featuring primarily queer characters stayed close to my heart throughout 
							my childhood and even into adulthood. At one point, I had the entire first 
							half of the 2 hour 15 minute movie memorized. My mom and I would play the 
							soundtrack constantly. 
							My mom saw the Broadway production a month after I was born in 1997 and 
							still had a t-shirt from the night. It had the coolest cyclops graphic of 
							Mimi holding her candle from the “Will you light my candle?” scene. Eventually, 
							she gave the shirt to me and I wore it to literal rags. When I finally accepted 
							another round in the washing machine would turn my beloved heirloom to dust, 
							I decided the best way to keep it close was to get it tattooed on my leg.

						thrown into navigating “adulthood”, attempting to repair a hopeless 
						relationship that continued on for years after, and dealing with an 
						undiagnosable issue that led me to have chronic pelvic pain for 9 months. 
						I spent months begging doctors to help me, trying to convince them there was 
						something wrong with me and I wasn’t just experiencing psychosomatic symptoms 
						of trauma. 
						In the process of trying to figure out what was causing my constant pain, it 
						was discovered my uterus was misshapen; looking like a heart instead of an oval
						 due to an incomplete connection of the two halves in the womb. They didn’t 
						 give me much information on it or the severity with which I had it, but they 
						 let me know in brutal passing that it would likely affect my ability to 
						 conceive or have healthy pregnancies. 
						I was incredibly distraught by this news as someone who has wanted to have 
						kids since I could ever remember. In the pain of this new understanding of my 
						body I turned to my favorite way of processing big emotions; art. I drew the 
						original version of this tattoo. Mandrake roots are a prominent symbol of 
						fertility in many African cultures and my art had often incorporated fetuses of
						 varying beings while in high school so it felt fitting for many reasons. 
						I took the drawing to my artist, Yessi , and we altered it a bit to age well 
						and fit my arm the best. This has been one of my favorite tattoos since.

						<p id="washingmachine1-text" class="handwritten"> My mom had some of her childhood books

							opposed to more modern options. There was one book in particular 
							called “It will all come out in the wash” about a girl who spilled
							 green paint on something and was so scared to tell her parents 
							 she tried to fix it herself. Through trying to fix it, the disaster 
							 became worse and worse until finally she told her parents and they

							  the wash. And telling the adults, or the people that can help you, 
							  isn’t something that always means trouble or failure, but that you

							This lesson stuck with me. I am not always great at going to people

							During my high school struggle with depression, anxiety, and cPTSD 
							I resorted to a lot of destructive coping mechanisms. I knew a lot 
							of kids over the course of middle and high school who turned to self 
							harm and always thought it was a cop out. But eventually I found myself

							that are released when you’re engaging in something so terrifying and 
							dangerous but so immediately rewarding. On January 25th, 2016 I came to 
							therapy with a plastic bag full of everything I’d used or could use in 
							the future to self harm. I handed it to Leah, my therapist, and told her 
							I was finally ready. And I stuck to it. 
							My leg was covered in hundreds of tiny scars and for so long I was so 
							embarrassed; constantly in fear of someone asking me about what happened. 
							But then the tides began to change and I embraced the physical signs of my 
							healing journey. I always thought of covering them with a tattoo but instead 
							decided to incorporate a tattoo into the marks left behind. The white ink was 
							originally much brighter but in time, along with my scars, it has faded. Leah 
							the bee fades right alongside the memory of the hopeless nights I’d turn to 
							anything to escape. The more faint it all becomes, the more proud of myself

						<p id="room51-text" class="handwritten">When I was a senior in high school, I experienced a Sylvia 
							Plath-esque descent to madness that landed me in a therapeutic program I 
							attended 7 hours a day, 5 days a week. Being 18 at the time, I was placed in 
							an adult program despite still being a high school student and I was terrified. 
							I remember going through my intake process and being recommended to Room 5, 
							where the most “Process Groups” and “DBT” based groups took place. I was so 
							scared to explore the other rooms and the rest of the facility that I attended 
							all 3 groups a day from the same couch in room 5. 
							After a few days, I realized I wasn’t the only one who took such a habitual 
							approach. Everyone in the room shared the deepest parts of themselves for hours 
							a day with strangers and I surprisingly became very close with several of the 
							adults in the room. My best friends became women and men between the ages of 
							25-65 and I gained an unreal and unprecedented perspective. 
							We stayed in touch for several years after discharge and I still have a few of 
							them on Facebook, everyone has grown into such different people. Having the 
							opportunity to witness a stranger you knew in their worst moment of life evolve 
							is fascinating. Some of them were even parents to the friends I had at school 
							which gave me a secret perspective on the people around me. 
							I remember at the time I read something about creativity and how the color blue 
							supposedly stimulates the production of serotonin in the brain. This is why so 
							many social media apps used blue, the article also claimed that there were walls 
							painted blue in big think tank companies like google that workers would stare at 
							when they hit a creative block. For whatever reason this possible pseudoscience 
							stuck with me and I decided to get my “Room 5” tattoo in blue ink. I thought 
							it was ironic, a very secret funny, that the place I spent the most time with 
							the least amount of serotonin was in blue ink permanently on my arm. Stimulating 
							the thing I lacked desperately every time I looked at it.

						<p id="origamicrane1-text" class="handwritten">Junior year of high school my art teacher, Ms. Hood, had my table 
							spend 3 class periods folding paper cranes for another teacher’s 
							birthday party later that week. Our table had become really close 
							and we always had such a blast together. And we, of course, got way 
							too good at folding cranes during that week. We’d folded at least 300
							cranes and thus dubbed ourselves the crane gang. One day, one of the 
							girls fell asleep at the table and we stacked as many cranes on her 
							as we could before she woke up. We got to somewhere around 20 before 
							we were all laughing so hard we couldn’t contain ourselves. 
							Later, in senior year of high school I was put on a 2.5 day 51/50 hold 
							in an adult mental health wing. I was so utterly bored and anxious that 
							I decided to rip my patient manual into varying size squares and fold 
							them into paper cranes. I did that all day, every day, for the entirety 
							of my stay. I folded so many I formed a blister on my finger. I took 
							all the cranes with me when I left and strung them up to display in my 
							senior art show about my mental health.
							Paper cranes have since remained a symbol of this time for me. I can’t

								at the local junior high. One particularly difficult year, she lost 
								a student after a severe asthma attack she had over winter break. 
								My mom bought a 2.5 foot concrete Virgin Mary statue for her grave 
								and a matching one for our yard at home. The area of the yard where 
								we placed the statue began growing more foliage than any other part 
								of the yard and the morning glories my mom planted grew up an arch around 
								the statue. Mary became a very powerful and comforting figure in my life 
								as I continued to grow up and to this day remains one of the most powerful 
								spiritual figures in my life.
								I have always been a spiritual person and on the open-ended search for 
								figures I resonate with to guide me through the journey of life. Mary was 
								one of the first figures I connected with, but as my life continued I found 
								new and unexpected connections. When I was at the darkest point in my life 
								I found myself in a situation where I was high on shrooms for the first time 
								in an environment/company that was a recipe for absolute disaster. By some 
								miracle, I ended up having one of the best spiritual experiences of my life. 
								5 years later I still carry with me the lessons I learned on that trip. What 
								I learned during that experience was the beginning of me piecing myself 
								together over a very long period of time and getting myself out of the situation 
								I was in. A notable part of that trip I remember standing at a portal receiving 
								all this inexplicable information on animals and the one that came toward me with 
								the most recognition was a jaguar. From then on, I resonated with the animal more 
								than ever. 
								I hoped to create a large tattoo that expressed my various connections to these entities. 
								I followed Bubzee, the artist for this piece, on instagram for almost 10 years by 
								the time I saw her. From early on in high school, I knew one day I’d travel to Canada 
								where she lived and worked as a tattoo artist to receive one of her unique and 
								awe-inspiring tattoos. Her art inspired me endlessly and I knew it was something I would 
								absolutely do over the course of my life. One day, she announced she’d be doing a 
								visitation for the first time in the US and it happened to be in Oakland. I knew 
								immediately I had to book. I scheduled with her on the spot and put myself down for my 
								sternum piece. I knew I wanted to let her take over a majority of the conceptualization 
								and creative process but focused toward my own prominent figures of spiritual guidance. 
								I took my dear friend Alex with me to this session and we spent the weekend in San 
								Francisco. My session was in a house in probably the coolest bedroom I’ve ever seen, 
								a witch’s lair is a better description quite honestly. The tattoo was the most painful 
								thing I’d ever experienced and if it weren’t for Alex and Bubzee encouraging me through 
								each hour, I absolutely would’ve tapped out. I now wear this adornment with absolute 
								pride. A check off the bucket list.

								at that time and the pansy to represent my then-identity of pansexuality.

						<p id="centipede1-text" class="handwritten">My biological father wasn’t exactly the most 
							present in my life; especially after the age of 12 when our 
							relationship came to an effective halt. Despite the contention 
							between us, I have a lot of fond memories from childhood when he 
							was present. I remember he loved to roughhouse with us and we 
							spent a lot of time playing outside or in pools at hotels, local 
							YMCAs, or parks. There was one game we played in the pool called 
							“pincher worms” where he’d hold his first two fingers out like a peace 
							sign to mimic the antennae of a worm splashing through the water like 
							dolphins trying to catch me and my brother and pinch us. And let me tell 
							you, if he caught us there was no holding back. Pinching, tickling, and 
							laughing galore. It was a very effective way to tire us out and I remember 
							vividly my very real fear of these mystic creatures.
							As a kid I always imagined the pincher worms as centipedes (my least 
							favorite creature at the time) with human arms instead of antennae reaching 
							out to grab me. I was terrified to say the least. Even as I grew older and 
							distanced myself from the possibility of a relationship with my biological 
							father, I always kept the few positive memories with me. One day, I decided 
							to draw out my imagined nemesis and realized what a cool tattoo it would be.
							I wanted to open more of a space in my heart to hold on to the positive things 
							about my dad. I decided to go through with the tattoo when I was in San 
							Francisco with a friend of mine. The girl who did the tattoo, Rhianna, 
							completely revamped my drawing and I was in love. The tattoo was so painful 
							close to the elbow but she was a sweetheart about it and numbed me without me 
							ever asking. I never knew numbing for a tattoo was a thing but it blew my mind 
							how much it changed the experience. 
							Later, my brother asked if he could copy the idea. He took the concept to 
							another artist and ended up getting a restyled version of the same thing. I 
							love mine, but his is undeniably sick as fuck. And they’re a beautiful memorial 
							to our dad who has since passed away.

						<p id="noboats1-text" class="handwritten">If it isn’t yet apparent, I am an incredibly sentimental and sappy individual. 
							My senior year of high school, upon graduation, I gave handwritten letters to 
							all the teachers who influenced me most in my 4 years there. One teacher in 
							particular, Mr Whetstone, gave me a safe place I needed that year more than 
							ever and I read my letter out loud to him. It was a very sweet and emotional 
							moment I still hold dear to me. 
							A few days later, he wrote me a letter back. In this letter, he wrote “Life 
							throws you big waves, but you are not a tiny boat”. Immediately, I knew this 
							was something that would stick with me. I’ve used it in times of stress ever 
							since, reminding myself what I am capable of. I am not a tiny boat. 
							At the time I got this tattoo, I had begun exploring boundaries with my 
							therapist. I have always struggled with having and keeping healthy boundaries. 
							Julie showed me a diagram of the 3 types of boundaries. A solid line for rigid, 
							an even dotted line for healthy, and a very spaced out dotted line for porous. 
							This image made a lot of sense to me and I wanted the reminder with me always 
							as I began to navigate a life with healthier boundaries. 
							I decided to create this tattoo with a  tiny boat crossed out with a red circle 
							and x with the boundary lines to remind me of the control I have in co-creating 
							situations for the best possible outcome and overcoming my stressors by 
							remaining tenacious. I got this tattoo the day after my 21st birthday.
