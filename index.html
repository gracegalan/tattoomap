					<div id="mandrake1-left"><p id="mandrake1-text">When I dropped out of college I was immediately 
						thrown into navigating “adulthood”, attempting to repair a hopeless 
						relationship that continued on for years after, and dealing with an 
						undiagnosable issue that led me to have chronic pelvic pain for 9 months. 
						I spent months begging doctors to help me, trying to convince them there was 
						something wrong with me and I wasn’t just experiencing psychosomatic symptoms 
						of trauma. 
						In the process of trying to figure out what was causing my constant pain, it 
						was discovered my uterus was misshapen; looking like a heart instead of an oval
						 due to an incomplete connection of the two halves in the womb. They didn’t 
						 give me much information on it or the severity with which I had it, but they 
						 let me know in brutal passing that it would likely affect my ability to 
						 conceive or have healthy pregnancies. 
						I was incredibly distraught by this news as someone who has wanted to have 
						kids since I could ever remember. In the pain of this new understanding of my 
						body I turned to my favorite way of processing big emotions; art. I drew the 
						original version of this tattoo. Mandrake roots are a prominent symbol of 
						fertility in many African cultures and my art had often incorporated fetuses of
						 varying beings while in high school so it felt fitting for many reasons. 
						I took the drawing to my artist, Yessi , and we altered it a bit to age well 
						and fit my arm the best. This has been one of my favorite tattoos since.

						<!--<p id="washingmachine1-text"> My mom had some of her childhood books 
							still when we were children and often shared them with us as 
							opposed to more modern options. There was one book in particular 
							called “It will all come out in the wash” about a girl who spilled
							 green paint on something and was so scared to tell her parents 
							 she tried to fix it herself. Through trying to fix it, the disaster 
							 became worse and worse until finally she told her parents and they 
							 simply helped her clean the mess. They reminded the girl, at the 
							  end of the day no matter how bad it gets, it will all come out in 
							  the wash. And telling the adults, or the people that can help you, 
							  isn’t something that always means trouble or failure, but that you 
							  have people around you who can support and help you.
							This lesson stuck with me. I am not always great at going to people 
							for help, though this is a reminder to do that. I am also much better
							 at understanding mistakes are temporary and fixable because of this 
							 book. They are part of life. And in the end, it’ll all come out in 
							 the wash.

							The semicolon project is an international movement for suicide 
							prevention and awareness. Throughout my childhood, I always 
							struggled with my mental health and handling the chaos of events 
							that occurred over the course of my life. In high school I 
							experienced my first deep depressive episode which landed me in a 
							partial hospitalization program and then on a suicide hold in the 
							hospital. I never attempted suicide outright but I had a plan, a 
							letter written I carried with me in my backpack every day, and 
							every intention to complete the plan. But, god save me, the moment 
							I knew I’d do it I went to my mom and told her I needed to be put 
							in the hospital immediately or I’d kill myself by the next morning. 
							I was taken to the hospital within 30 minutes and admitted on a 51/50. 
							Through therapy, hard work, support, and the proper medication regimen 
							I was able to stabilize enough to find hope in the world again. Through 
							the beginning of my recovery, and even now all these years later, I find 
							so much power in being open and authentic about my experiences with my 
							mental health. The mother’s day after I graduated from my therapy program, 
							my mom and I got matching semicolon tattoos. The author uses a semicolon 
							when they could end a sentence but decide to continue; and that’s exactly 
							what I did. 
							I love this tiny yet powerful tattoo, the solidarity that comes with a 
							simple flash of it to a stranger who has one too. It’s beautiful to find 
							these tiny connections in this life I love living but almost didn’t see 
							through.

							During my high school struggle with depression, anxiety, and cPTSD 
							I resorted to a lot of destructive coping mechanisms. I knew a lot 
							of kids over the course of middle and high school who turned to self 
							harm and always thought it was a cop out. But eventually I found myself 
							turning to the dangerous habit. It spiraled out of control as I reached 
							the beginning of my treatment journey and by the time I was admitted it 
							was at an almost obsessive level. 
							I tried for months to quit but I’d make it 2-4 days and relapse. My 
							therapist always treated me so compassionately, explaining to me that 
							often people become chemically addicted to the dopamine and adrenaline 
							that are released when you’re engaging in something so terrifying and 
							dangerous but so immediately rewarding. On January 25th, 2016 I came to 
							therapy with a plastic bag full of everything I’d used or could use in 
							the future to self harm. I handed it to Leah, my therapist, and told her 
							I was finally ready. And I stuck to it. 
							My leg was covered in hundreds of tiny scars and for so long I was so 
							embarrassed; constantly in fear of someone asking me about what happened. 
							But then the tides began to change and I embraced the physical signs of my 
							healing journey. I always thought of covering them with a tattoo but instead 
							decided to incorporate a tattoo into the marks left behind. The white ink was 
							originally much brighter but in time, along with my scars, it has faded. Leah 
							the bee fades right alongside the memory of the hopeless nights I’d turn to 
							anything to escape. The more faint it all becomes, the more proud of myself 
							I feel.

						<p id="room51-text">When I was a senior in high school, I experienced a Sylvia 
							Plath-esque descent to madness that landed me in a therapeutic program I 
							attended 7 hours a day, 5 days a week. Being 18 at the time, I was placed in 
							an adult program despite still being a high school student and I was terrified. 
							I remember going through my intake process and being recommended to Room 5, 
							where the most “Process Groups” and “DBT” based groups took place. I was so 
							scared to explore the other rooms and the rest of the facility that I attended 
							all 3 groups a day from the same couch in room 5. 
							After a few days, I realized I wasn’t the only one who took such a habitual 
							approach. Everyone in the room shared the deepest parts of themselves for hours 
							a day with strangers and I surprisingly became very close with several of the 
							adults in the room. My best friends became women and men between the ages of 
							25-65 and I gained an unreal and unprecedented perspective. 
							We stayed in touch for several years after discharge and I still have a few of 
							them on Facebook, everyone has grown into such different people. Having the 
							opportunity to witness a stranger you knew in their worst moment of life evolve 
							is fascinating. Some of them were even parents to the friends I had at school 
							which gave me a secret perspective on the people around me. 
							I remember at the time I read something about creativity and how the color blue 
							supposedly stimulates the production of serotonin in the brain. This is why so 
							many social media apps used blue, the article also claimed that there were walls 
							painted blue in big think tank companies like google that workers would stare at 
							when they hit a creative block. For whatever reason this possible pseudoscience 
							stuck with me and I decided to get my “Room 5” tattoo in blue ink. I thought 
							it was ironic, a very secret funny, that the place I spent the most time with 
							the least amount of serotonin was in blue ink permanently on my arm. Stimulating 
							the thing I lacked desperately every time I looked at it.
