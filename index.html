                            <p> I was 12 years old living in a tiny midwestern town the first time
                            I heard this song. My love for classical music started at a young age
                            due to my involvement in ballet and I wanted explore new artists. I was quickly
                            enamored and immediately did a deep dive on the artist, Olafur Arnalds, and his 
                            hometown in Iceland.</p>
                            <p>Around the same time in my life, I experienced my first panic attack.
                            I found that listening to this album helped me more than anything. 
                            And looking at pictures of Iceland brought me a sense of calm I have never 
                            been able to describe properly.</p> 
                            <p>I went through the album and translated each of the titles. Before translating
                            this title, this song particularly resonated with me and after learning it translates 
                            to “Slowly, comes light” I knew it'd be both a comforting mantra and my first tattoo.</p>

							The semicolon project is an international movement for suicide

							I was taken to the hospital within 30 minutes and admitted on a 51/50. 
							Through therapy, hard work, support, and the proper medication regimen

							During my high school struggle with depression and anxiety 
							I resorted to a lot of destructive coping mechanisms. I knew a lot 
							of kids over the course of middle and high school who turned to self 
							harm and always thought it was a cop out. Eventually I found myself 
							turning to the dangerous habit. It spiraled out of control as I reached 
							the beginning of my treatment journey and by the time I was admitted it 
							was at an obsessive level. 
							I tried for months to quit but I’d make it 2-4 days and relapse. My 
							therapist always treated me so compassionately, explaining to me that 
							often people become chemically addicted to the dopamine and adrenaline 
							that are released when you’re engaging in something so terrifying and 
							dangerous but so immediately rewarding. On January 25th, 2016 I came to 
							therapy with a plastic bag full of everything I’d used or could use in 
							the future to self harm. I was finally ready. And I stuck to it. 
							My leg was covered in hundreds of tiny scars and for so long I was so 
							embarrassed; constantly in fear of someone asking me about what happened. 
							But then the tides began to change and I embraced the physical signs of my 
							healing journey. I always thought of covering them with a tattoo but instead 
							decided to incorporate a tattoo into the marks left behind. The white ink was 
							originally much brighter but in time, along with my scars, it has faded. Leah 
							the bee fades right alongside the memory of the hopeless nights I’d turn to 
							anything to escape. The more faint it all becomes, the more proud of myself

						<p id="room51-text" class="handwritten">When I was a senior in high school, I experienced a Sylvia 
							Plath-esque descent to madness that landed me in a therapeutic program. Being 18 at the 
							time, I was placed in an adult program despite still being a high school student 
							and I was terrified. During my intake, I was recommended to Room 5, 
							where the most “Process Groups” took place. I was so 
							scared to explore the other rooms I spent 3 groups a day in room 5. 
							After a few days, I realized I wasn’t the only one who took such a habitual 
							approach. Everyone in the room shared the deepest parts of themselves for hours 
							a day with strangers and I surprisingly became very close with several of the 
							adults in the room. My best friends became women and men between the ages of 
							25-65 and I gained an unreal and unprecedented perspective. 
							We stayed in touch for several years after discharge and I still have a few of 
							them on Facebook. Having the opportunity to witness a stranger you knew in their 
							worst moment of life evolve is fascinating. Some of them were even parents to the 
							friends I had at school which gave me a secret perspective on the people around me. 
							I remember at the time I read something about creativity and how the color blue 
							supposedly stimulates the production of serotonin in the brain. This is why so 
							many social media apps used blue, the article also claimed that there were walls 
							painted blue in big think tank companies like google that workers would stare at 
							when they hit a creative block. For whatever reason this stuck with me and I decided 
							to get my “Room 5” tattoo in blue ink. I thought it was ironic, and secretly funny, 
							that the place I spent the most time with the least amount of serotonin was in 
							blue ink permanently on my arm; stimulating the thing I lacked desperately every time 
							I looked at it.

						<p id="origamicrane1-text" class="handwritten">Junior year of high school my art teacher, Ms. Hood, had my table

							birthday party later that week. Our table had become really close 
							and we always had such a blast together. And we, of course, got way 
							too good at folding cranes during that week. We’d folded at least 300
							cranes and thus dubbed ourselves the crane gang. One day, one of the 
							girls fell asleep at the table and we stacked as many cranes on her 
							as we could before she woke up. We got to somewhere around 20 before 
							we were all laughing so hard we couldn’t contain ourselves. 
							Later, in senior year of high school I was put on a 2.5 day 51/50 hold 
							in an adult mental health wing. I was so utterly bored and anxious that 
							I decided to rip my patient manual into varying size squares and fold 
							them into paper cranes. I did that all day, every day, for the entirety 
							of my stay. I folded so many I formed a blister on my finger. I took 
							all the cranes with me when I left and strung them up to display in my

							At the time I got this tattoo, I had begun exploring boundaries with my 
							therapist. Julie showed me a diagram of the 3 types of boundaries. A solid line for rigid, 
							an even dotted line for healthy, and a very spaced out dotted line for porous. 
							I decided to create this tattoo to remind me of the control I have in co-creating 
							situations for the best possible outcome and overcoming my stressors by 
							remaining tenacious.
